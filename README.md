# UI-Van
This project was built out of a previous project and therefore
contains extraneous files (especially the less files that I did not want to remove
and break anything). The only files used on this project
are about.html, features.html, and index.html

##JS Files
3 JS files exist, one for each page. About.js is for About.html, 
main.js is for index.html, and accordian.js is for Features.html. 

##Less files
The main less file is main.less. This contains almost all of the 
styling for the website.
